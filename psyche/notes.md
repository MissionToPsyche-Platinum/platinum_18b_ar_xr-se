## Domain options

- Cloudflare
- Github Pages setup
- no-ip free hosting
- some Pysche hosted option

## Thoughts

- Github pages seems like the best option, but have to look into how that works with a repo I don't own
- I don't like hosting on my own hardware as it creates a security concern for me (plus I am moving so there will be a lapse in connection)
- Psyche might have specific requirements for hosting.
- Sponsor suggested Firebase might be an option
